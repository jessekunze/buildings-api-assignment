2. `mvn clean install` - this also runs all the unit tests
3. `mvn spring-boot:run` 
 - this invokes the project and binds the server to port 8080 

#### Docker

Alternatively, if there are issues with local installs of Java or Maven, you can build/test/run the app with Docker.

    docker build -t buildings-api-assignment .
    docker run -it -p8080:8080 buildings-api-assignment

#### How to invoke and access the default (root) controller
1. From the command line `curl localhost:8080`
2. From a browser http://localhost:8080
3. From Postman `GET http://localhost:8080`

#### Special notes
1. This project uses Lombok to generate boilerplate getters/setters
2. To install [Lombok](https://projectlombok.org/)
3. We strongly recommend [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/) - community edition is free
